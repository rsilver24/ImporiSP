# ImporiSP

This is the final rendition of the game Impori, made by Roan Silver. This is a simple board game made over the course of the 2023-2024 school year. This repository is made up of 3 main segments, as described below:

The folder "Impori" holds the Project Settings, Assets, and Packages, and general content of the game. This is what should be imported if you would like to copy the game in your Unity program. Everything here is left in its normal form, and should be easily accessable and edited. IMPORTANT: This does NOT run on its own. You MUST import this directly into Unity itself.

The folder other Impori folder (marked by text after "Impori") holds the game itself. This is the build with all of the valid build settings. If you do not wish to run this game in Unity, download this folder, compile it, then run it. This is JUST the game itself and unless you want to pain yourself with logistics, cannot be edited on your end.

The pdf document "Impori Log" is, well, the log for the CIE period of this project. This was done over the course of ~2 weeks, and holds all the previous documentation relating to this project (and yes, I mean ALL of it, there is quite a bit), and also a daily log of what I did each day.

I hope you enjoy!
